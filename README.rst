Flatland
========
Although Edwin A. Abbott's essay "Flatland" is readily available on the
internet, I failed to find a nicely typeset version. At this time,
the rendering quality of internet browsers doesn't come anywhere near the
quality of a nice book. 

For these reasons, as well as a healthy portion of boredom, I made the version
of "Flatland" you are currently reading, in LaTeX. The LaTeX source can be
found on https://github.com/Ivesvdf/flatland (feel free to make issues
or send me pull requests when you find bugs or have improvements). It should
also be fairly easy --- a matter of minutes --- to produce a book-sized
version, ready to send to a printer.
